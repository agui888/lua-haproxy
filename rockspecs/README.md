# lua-haproxy rockspecs

**N.B.** In general, directories under the top-level should be singular
(`rockspec` cf.  `rockspecs`). However, `luarocks make` does not differentiate
between files and directories matching `rockspec$`. This directory should be
renamed when [the fix][1] makes it to the next LuaRocks release.
